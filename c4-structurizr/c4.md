# C4 and Structurizr Cheatsheet

- [C4](https://c4model.com/): a lightweight architecture model that is approachable for many different roles
- [Structurizr](https://docs.structurizr.com/): a software implementation using the C4 model to create and render diagrams.
- [sturcutrizr-lite](https://docs.structurizr.com/lite)


Steps:

- Install Docker command line and Docker Desktop
- Install [Structurizr Lite](https://docs.structurizr.com/lite/installation) docker container.

Running Structurizr Lite locally for the various models in development:

HFRNet is one project I was working on initially. Launching Structurizr Lite on the hfrnet DSL code folder

```zsh
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v /Volumes/develop/hfrnet/architecture/:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/lite
```

Currently, download all the diagrams from the web server in png and svg formats and put them in a Google Slide show, there has to be a better way.  Experiment with Github pages later
